/*Create a text adventure game where players navigate a maze of rooms stored in a 2D array.
* Use a custom class for each type of room, derived from a common Room class. Each type of room should output a custom message or obstacle for the player to overcome. 
* Your game map can be hand-crafted, or you may choose to use an algorithm to randomly allocate rooms in your 2D maze.
* Either way, your game does not need to be large (an 4x4 array is sufficient).
* The focus of this assessment is on your use of inheritance, and your ability to parse and process user input.
* For this assessment you must create a console application in C++ that includes the following features:
	* The ability to parse and process commands typed by the user 
	* For example, 'move east' will move the player to the next room east of their current location. 
	* Stores a 'maze' of rooms within a 2D array data structure 
	* Uses custom classes to define a hierarchy of room types. Each room type is to be derived from a common Room class 
	* Each type of room should output a custom message or obstacle for the player to overcome. 
* You are free to design all other aspects of the program.
* You will use version control throughout this assessment to maintain an archive of your work and to track changes. A commit log or screenshot showing the use of version control software is to be submitted with your project.*/
